﻿What is BatchProcessing?
#########################

Batch Processing allows you to automate a number of processes available
in t4su, rather than working with point-and-click.

You
first need to plot the points of interest, through a sampling
method, or by importing a
layer or geo-localized points. Using predefined data for your calculations allows
for a more precise result than using your mouse for each individual
point, and may be time-saving depending on the number of points you
have.

Once you click \ **Extensions > Misc > BatchProcess**, the
following box will appear :

Select the process you are
working on. For more information on what each individual process does,
click on the links below.

Select your layer containing your data points. These will be at the
center of your disks (if you work in 2D) or spheres (for 3D Isovists or
Sky Mapping), or the origin of your rays (in the case of Ray Casting).

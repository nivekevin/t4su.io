ï»¿Drawing Sun Paths
##################

Tools4SketchUp offers very different possibilities than the built-in
Shadow feature or other plugins available.

The first step in your solar analysis should be to set the location of
your project, as well as setting the time-period for your analysis. This
will be automatically translated into the appropriate Sun Paths.

First, click on **Extensions > t4su > Sun views > SunPath :**

The next window allows you to enter the necessary information for the
creation of sun paths :

-  Set the correct latitude.
-  Set the start date and time
-  Set the end date and time

It is sometimes practical to select dates that are of special interest
for solar paths such as the solstices : the 21st of June and 21st of
December represent the highest and lowest paths of the year,
respectively.

-  The daily sun path is a continuous line in the sky, which is here
   represented by a series of points. You can therefore decide on the
   interval of time (in minutes) at which the position of the sun is
   saved.
-  If your start and end dates are not on the same day, you will have a
   series of sun paths. If you don't wish to trace a path for every
   single day, you can change this parameter : setting "2" will trace
   one path every two days. Setting "30" will trace a path roughly every
   month.

Once your sun paths have been traced and placed in a Layer, as well as
triangulated your
geometries, 
you will be ready to run analyses such as Sun View Factor.

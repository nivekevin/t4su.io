2D Sky Maps and Vegetation Modelization
########################################

As we have seen, we can easily cover large areas by multiplying a single
object, such as a person to make a crowd or a tree to make a forest.
There are more than `1400 trees to choose
from <https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/search.html?q=3d+trees&rsi=sbis&backendClass=entity>`__\ in
the 3D Warehouse, you really have a large choice. So are all SketchUp
trees the same? What types are there and how do they affect the results
of our visibility studies? Let's take two concrete examples.

First Tree : the FaceMe Tree
============================

If you're familiar with Sketchup, you may know about
the \ `faceMe <https://blog.sketchup.com/sketchupdate/making-your-own-face-me-people>`__ technique.
Basically, a 2D Object is set to automatically turn to always face your
camera, no matter which way you look at it (unless you look from above).

Second Tree : the Carboard Cutout
=================================

The Cardboard Cutout also uses the faceMe method for it's vertical face,
but also has an added horizontal face.

Comparison :
============

Let's now compare the impact these two different trees would have on our
visibility studies. For starters, are the sky maps the same? If they're
not, what else would that change? To find out, import both types of
trees into different layers, and place them at identical spots. To make
sure we compare the same points in space, we can create a path, sample it and
project the sampling points over our terrain. We can then launch a 2D
Sky
Map \ Batchprocess over
our sampled path twice ; once for each tree layer type.

   Comparison of Both Sky view Factors.


Clearly, trees composed of only
a vertical face allow for a much greater sky view factor. In this
particular case, a greater sky view also means greater direct solar
radiation.

Conclusion:
===========

Choosing the correct type of tree is very important : they're part of
every urban setting and need to be taken into account when analysing
urban energy balances. Vegetation's correct integration in such
simulations is still at its premise, mainly because their modelization
induces calculating variable opacity over many complex shapes.
Comparatively, this SketchUp method may not be as precise as other
microclimatic models, but it's definitely much faster. In any case, it's
vital to know what type of geometries we're working with and anticipate
the types of problems that could be encountered, whether it be a 2D, 2D+
or 3D tree model.
